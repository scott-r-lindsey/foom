# Electron shard balance

CI runs four named-test shards per platform. `tests/electron/shard-plan.json`
assigns measured tests to shards; `test-shard.js` hashes new or renamed tests,
and all tests at other shard counts. With no shard setting the full suite runs.
Native hooks and packaging still run only on shard 1. The Quality gate requires
all twelve Electron jobs. Test deadlines, step limits and retries are unchanged.

## Measurements

Downloaded all nine `electron-results-*` artifacts from green main runs
[38627968212](https://github.com/scott-r-lindsey/foom/actions/runs/38627968212)
and [38611379264](https://github.com/scott-r-lindsey/foom/actions/runs/38611379264).
Each contains 119 named cases across three shards.

Run 38627968212, seconds in shard order (1, 2, 3):

| Platform | JUnit case duration sums | Electron step wall time | Step limit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Linux | 302.8 / 164.8 / 267.4 | 315 / 180 / 279 | 420 |
| Windows | 476.9 / 444.3 / 379.6 | 495 / 470 / 401 | 600 |
| macOS | 530.4 / 328.2 / 487.3 | 551 / 353 / 516 | 600 |

The second run's total case durations were Linux 725.6s, Windows 1235.5s,
and macOS 1177.9s. In the newer run macOS totals 1345.9s: even perfect
three-way balancing needs 448.6s before build/runner overhead, already at 75%
of the ten-minute step limit. Four shards provide room for that overhead and
variation without increasing timeouts.

## Assignment method

The plan records seconds per test in the listed platform order, taking the
maximum observed duration on each platform across the two source runs. Sort
cases by descending maximum fraction of a platform's total duration, breaking
ties by test name. Place each case on the shard that minimizes the largest
projected fraction across all platform/shard pairs; break ties by the selected
shard's sum of platform fractions, then shard index. This balances all three
platforms with one deterministic assignment.

Conservative projected case sums (maxima across both runs), seconds:

| Platform | Shard 1 | Shard 2 | Shard 3 | Shard 4 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Linux | 188.1 | 185.2 | 183.1 | 189.2 |
| Windows | 340.6 | 344.1 | 336.6 | 337.4 |
| macOS | 337.0 | 344.6 | 345.4 | 329.6 |

These are estimates, excluding build/runner overhead. Compare new CI JUnit
and step wall times when refreshing the plan. Update the source runs, durations
and assignment together. The shard integration test catches stale/duplicate
plan names, checks the explicit assignment and hash fallback, and verifies
exactly-once registration, name filtering and invalid-setting failures.
